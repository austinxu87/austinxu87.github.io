        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu">the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> and the <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu/"> the Center for Machine Learning</a> at Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by
          <a href="https://www.mdav.ece.gatech.edu/">Mark Davenport</a> and to be a <a href="https://mlatgt.blog/2021/05/10/the-machine-learning-center-awards-inaugural-mlgt-fellows/">ML@GT Fellow</a>. I graduated with a BSE in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/">
            University of Michigan</a> in May 2019 (Go Blue!).</p>

        <p>Broadly, I am interested in facillitating human-machine collaboration in an interpretable and mathematically grounded manner. I believe that such collaboration requires two-way communication; machines need to be able to quickly understand human preferences, while humans need to understand a machine's decision making process.
          As a result, my work is focused on both sides of human-machine communication: (1) Learning from non-metric queries (e.g. paired comparisons) and (2) understanding and explaining how machine learning classifiers make decisions. </p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy cooking (and eating), reading, running, and watching basketball (NBA and college).</p>
